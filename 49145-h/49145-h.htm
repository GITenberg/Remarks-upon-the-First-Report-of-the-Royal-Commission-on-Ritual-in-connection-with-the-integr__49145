<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>REMARKS
UPON THE FIRST REPORT OF THE<br />
ROYAL COMMISSION ON RITUAL, <span class="smcap">Etc</span>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Executive of the Brighton
Branch of the English Church Union, through you, sir, their
Chairman, have, too rashly, I fear, as well as too kindly,
supposed that I might have something to say upon the above
subject which may repay this assemblage of Churchmen for their
trouble in coming here this evening.&nbsp; It is certainly not
for me to say you have deluded them, but rather, without wasting
time in apology, to do my best to save (if it may be so) your
credit and my own; and, what is of more consequence, to throw
some light upon the very important matter to which my remarks are
to be directed.&nbsp; At any rate, the great importance of the
subject itself and the imminent likelihood of some action being
taken to disarrange or subvert the present standing of the Church
of England by an alteration in her Book of Common Prayer will
ensure your deep interest, and, I do not doubt, secure me an
indulgent hearing; whilst the very large and influential,
and,&mdash;I think it will be on all hands allowed,&mdash;most
successful meeting held last week in London, gives an additional
reason for strengthening, if it may be so, the action then taken
by diffusing as widely as possible information as to the dangers
apprehended, and the means of resistance to be used in order to
preserve its integrity.</p>
<p>It is a trite saying just now that there is a great crisis in
Church affairs; but I think it must be allowed to be not less
true than trite, even after making all allowance for the
magnitude with which the time present always invests things
present.&nbsp; In secular and material warfare it may be that
sometimes an underrating difficulties, a blindness to the peril,
is the very cause and means of safety or success.&nbsp; But in
assaults like the present, where the battle-field is the Law and
Order of the Church, where the contest is carried on not with
sword or spear, but with the keen weapons of <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>intellectual
and moral contention, where very much turns and must turn upon
the enlistment of public opinion upon this side or that; where
prejudice, and ridicule, and sneer, and scoff, appealing
constantly to the irreverence and perverseness of the evil side
of human nature, backed up in large measure, as might be
expected, by a licentious and unbelieving press, adapting itself
to a licentious and unbelieving age; where these things are the
daily engines of assault, there would seem to be no safety in
shutting our eyes to the danger, merely hoping that all
&ldquo;will come some strange way right at last.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Especially when the assault is made upon doctrine, either
directly or indirectly, (for if it be upon ceremonial
representing doctrine it is indirectly upon doctrine itself,)
when it takes the form of assault upon the integrity of the
Prayer Book, and the Catholic <i>status</i> of the Church of
England in connection with it, we must be wise, and wary, and
far-seeing to the utmost of our vision, if we would duly organize
our defence and fight <i>well</i> the battle for God&rsquo;s
Church and Gods Truth.&nbsp; We must indeed try not to exaggerate
anything, but we must also endeavour not to underrate any real
danger which exists, and especially not suffer our citadel to be
undermined, whilst we are merely regarding a plausible or fair
surface.</p>
<p>There seems, too, to be a peculiar and apt propriety in this
term crisis, as applied to the present aspect of Church
affairs.&nbsp; It is not merely that there is a great
<i>danger</i>, but a danger coming to a head, which, if happily
now overcome, will again subside.&nbsp; Johnson gives as the
first sense of crisis, &ldquo;The point in which the disease
kills or changes to the better;&rdquo; and, as the second,
&ldquo;The point of time at which any affair comes to the
height,&rdquo; according to the exact use of the word by
Dryden:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Now is the very <i>crisis</i> of your fate,<br />
And all the colour of your life depends<br />
On this important Now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And we may well believe that if the present dangers which
beset the Church of England be overcome, God may have in store
for her a very glorious future indeed, even to her being a great
instrument in His hand, not merely for the <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>spreading His
Kingdom here at home, but also (may He in mercy grant it) for the
restoration of the Unity of Christendom, and thereby for the
Evangelization of the world.&nbsp; As our hopes of this must,
however, depend upon her being able to maintain her Catholicity,
so must we watch with the most jealous care, and resist with the
firmest constancy all which shall impair, her maintenance of
Catholic truth and that position which God of His mercy has
hitherto permitted her to hold.</p>
<p>One great means of her maintaining this position is the
maintaining untouched her Book of Common Prayer, and therefore
there is and must be need of the most careful watchfulness as to
every threatening of assault upon it.</p>
<p>Now I affirm without hesitation that the first Report of the
Royal Commission, appointed, to use its own terms, &ldquo;to
enquire into the Rubrics, Orders, and Directions for regulating
the course and conduct of public worship, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
according to the use of the United Church of England and
Ireland,&rdquo; threatens, and even leads, such an assault.&nbsp;
And this gives the connection of the two parts of my subject as
announced to you in the title of this Lecture.</p>
<p>As to this threatening or assault contained in the Report,
take a witness the most unexceptionable perhaps of any who may be
found anywhere, and one whose testimony is only the more
convincing as to the danger because he himself does not see it at
all, so that it is impossible to suppose him to be straining
anything to make a case.&nbsp; Nay, he does not consider what he
himself suggests or advocates as a measure carrying out the
recommendations of the Report, or as a means to remedy certain
embarrassments, to be an alteration in the Prayer Book at
all.&nbsp; In his recent Charge, the Bishop of Gloucester and
Bristol (himself one of the Commissioners), after considering and
dismissing as useless or dangerous, or otherwise inadmissible,
several other plans, recommends this:&mdash;&ldquo;A simple and
positive enactment declaring what shall be, and be considered to
be, the ministerial dress, until further order be taken
concerning the same by lawful authority.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he
adds;&mdash;&ldquo;This of course must be by direct
legislation.&nbsp; We may shrink from <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>it,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;but in
my judgment it is now inevitable.&nbsp; The very appointment of
the Commission seems to involve it, and the general temper of the
country will demand it.&rdquo; <a name="citation6"></a><a
href="#footnote6" class="citation">[6]</a>&nbsp; If the
Bishop&rsquo;s witness is that the mere appointment of the
Commission seems to involve a legislative measure touching the
Prayer Book, how much more does its Report&mdash;leading even
such a man as the Bishop on to advocate it&mdash;shew that here
is <i>more</i> than a threatening of assault upon it!</p>
<p>Perhaps we shall have something by and by to add upon the
views and recommendations of the Bishop of Gloucester and
Bristol&rsquo;s Charge.&nbsp; At present I merely cite this
passage as an evidence that the appointment and work of the Royal
Commission tend directly to an alteration in the Book of Common
Prayer, because such an enactment as is here contemplated would
be, I must venture to affirm, whatever his lordship may suppose,
a repeal of the Rubric on Ornaments as it stands, and has stood
since the last revision.&nbsp; To this, however, I shall have
occasion to refer again in the sequel.</p>
<p>But now let us turn for a little while to the Report itself,
as issued by the Commissioners on the nineteenth of August,
1867.&nbsp; After reciting the matters for enquiry contained in
their appointment, the Commissioners say:&mdash;&ldquo;We, your
Majesty&rsquo;s Commissioners, have, in accordance with the terms
of your Majesty&rsquo;s Commission, directed our first attention
to the question of the vestments worn by the ministers of the
said United Church at the time of their ministration, and
especially to those the use of which has been lately introduced
into certain churches.&rdquo;&nbsp; They proceed:&mdash;&ldquo;We
find that whilst these vestments are regarded by some witnesses
as symbolical of doctrine, and by others as a distinctive vesture
whereby they desire to do honour to the Holy Communion as the
highest act of Christian worship, they are <i>by none regarded as
essential</i>, <i>and they give grave offence to
many</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this premiss they arrive at the following
conclusion:&mdash;&ldquo;We are of opinion that it is expedient
to restrain in the public Services of the United Church of
England and Ireland <i>all variations</i> in respect of vesture
from that which <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>has long been the established usage of the said United
Church; and we think that this may be best secured by providing
<i>Aggrieved Parishioners</i> with an easy and effectual process
for complaint and redress.&rdquo;&nbsp; They then state that they
have not yet arrived at a conclusion how best effect may be given
to this recommendation, but they have (they say <a
name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7"
class="citation">[7]</a>) &ldquo;deemed it to be their duty in a
matter to which great interest is attached not to delay the
communication to her Majesty of the results at which they have
already arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now from this, which is the whole substance of the Report, it
is evident that the conclusions of the Commissioners are wholly
based upon the ground that the vestments are &ldquo;by none
regarded as essential,&rdquo; whilst &ldquo;they give grave
offence to many.&rdquo;&nbsp; And of course the stress of the
argument, such as it is, rests upon their being admitted to be
<i>non-essential</i>; because, if they were <i>essential</i>, the
consideration of their giving grave offence to however many would
be no reason at all for restraint in the matter.&nbsp; A thousand
things give offence to a world lying in wickedness which are only
all the more to be proclaimed and declared on that account.&nbsp;
The &ldquo;offence of the Cross&rdquo; has not
&ldquo;ceased&rdquo; now any more than it had in S. Paul&rsquo;s
day.&nbsp; It is well known and widely spread, but this affords
no reason for restraining the preaching of the Cross.</p>
<p>But it may be said, admitting all this, yet as these vestments
are confessed to be <i>un</i>essential, the conclusion is very
sound that their use should be restrained; and, in fact, a great
deal has been made on all hands amongst the advocates of
restraint of this the solitary argument of the
Commissioners.&nbsp; There is often a sort of triumphant
appeal:&mdash;&ldquo;The Ritualists themselves admit the
vestments to be non-essential.&nbsp; What can be the hardship or
evil of compelling them to give them up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us examine this view a little more closely, and see
whether there be not a lurking fallacy running through the whole
argument.</p>
<p>In the first place, more than one of the witnesses has
repudiated the admission of the non-essentiality of these <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>things; and
even granting that the term may have been used, it is a further
question in what application or connection.&nbsp; Essential is a
relative term, depending as to its sense on the context in which
it occurs, or the subject matter upon which it bears.&nbsp; It
needs, therefore, in each case to be asked, Essential to
what?&nbsp; To the <i>being</i> or to the
<i>well-being</i>?&nbsp; There is here a great and important
difference.&nbsp; It is quite true that no one maintains that the
vestments are essential to the office of the priesthood, or to
the validity of any priestly act.&nbsp; But they may be essential
to the giving due expression to the act; and to give this due
expression may be essential to the salvation of many.&nbsp; Or
yet further, the <i>thing itself</i> may be unessential as to the
validity of acts done, and yet the <i>liberty</i> to use it may
be of essential importance&mdash;aye, even though it may give
grave offence to some, perhaps to many.</p>
<p>An illustration may possibly help us to estimate the true
value of the Commissioners&rsquo; argument, or, as I should
rather say, their sophism.&nbsp; And it seems very important to
shew that it is a sophism, because the paragraph in question in
their Report is the one thing reiterated over and over again by
the advocates of legislation or repression.&nbsp; It is the stock
argument, the only argument on which the demand for change is
based; and it is often urged as if it were irresistible, and
there were no reply to it.&nbsp; Let us, then, examine it, and
try to see its true force.</p>
<p>Now there is, as it seems to me, a very apt illustration of
its fallacy in a matter of ceremonial treated of in the 30th
Canon, and a matter, too, be it observed, where the ceremonial
referred to, and defended, was certainly not an essential of
Christianity, and as certainly, at the time, gave grave offence
to many.</p>
<p>The 30th Canon, by far the longest and most elaborate of the
Canons of 1603, treats of &ldquo;the lawful use of the Cross in
Baptism.&rdquo;&nbsp; The grave offence taken at this usage is
declared in the very first words of the Canon&mdash;&ldquo;We are
sorry that his Majesty&rsquo;s most princely care and pains taken
in the Conference at Hampton Court, amongst many other points
touching this one of the Cross in Baptism, hath <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>taken no better
effect with many, but that the use of it in Baptism is so gravely
stuck at and impugned.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then the Canon, instead
of upon this account recommending that the use be restrained, or
that persons aggrieved (&ldquo;Aggrieved Parishioners&rdquo;)
should have provided for them &ldquo;an easy and effectual
process for complaint and redress&rdquo; instead of this, the
Canon goes on to give various godly reasons why the usage should
be retained, even though it gave this grave offence&mdash;aye,
and though the cause of the offence was its being supposed to
have a savour of Rome, and though it was a matter in itself
indifferent.&nbsp; Without reciting the whole Canon we may remark
that the reasons stated are exactly such as, <i>mutatis
mutandis</i>, might be applied to the very ceremonial brought
under censure by the Commissioners; such as, that whilst some
derided it, others valued it and were edified by it; that it
brought into sight and kept in men&rsquo;s minds certain great
truths of the Gospel; that it had the weight and authority of
wide-spread and Catholic use; that not all which was of Roman
belief or practice was to be condemned, &amp;c., &amp;c.&nbsp; So
the Canon says &ldquo;it is to be observed that although the Jews
and Ethnics derided both the Apostles and the rest of the
Christians for preaching and believing in Him Who was crucified
upon the Cross; yet all, both Apostles and Christians, were so
far from being discouraged from their profession by the ignominy
of the Cross, as they rather rejoiced and triumphed in
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again, that &ldquo;the honour and dignity of the
name of the Cross begat a reverend estimation even in the
Apostles&rsquo; times (for aught that is known to the contrary)
of the sign of the Cross, which the Christians shortly after used
in all their actions.&rdquo;&nbsp; And although the Synod goes on
to &ldquo;confess that in process of time the sign of the Cross
was greatly abused in the Church of Rome,&rdquo; yet it affirms
in the plainest and most unhesitating manner the great principle,
that &ldquo;the abuse of a thing doth not take away the lawful
use of it;&rdquo; and adds, even further, &ldquo;Nay, so far was
it from the purpose of the Church of England to forsake and
reject the Churches of Italy, France, Spain, Germany, or any such
like Churches, in all things <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>which they held and practised, that,
as the Apology of the Church of England confesseth, it doth with
reverence retain those ceremonies which doth (do) neither
endamage the Church of God nor offend the minds of sober men; and
only departed from them in those particular points, wherein they
were fallen both from themselves in their ancient integrity, and
from the Apostolical Churches which were their first founders; in
which respect, amongst some other very ancient ceremonies, the
sign of the Cross in Baptism hath been retained in this
Church.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, all this seems to me not irrelevant to
many other ceremonies besides the sign of the Cross, and indeed
to have a very close bearing upon the principles on which a high
Ritual may be defended.&nbsp; But this is not all.&nbsp; We come
next to a point especially and peculiarly to our purpose, for the
Canon, going on to say that the sign of the Cross is retained
&ldquo;with such sufficient cautions and exceptions against . . .
superstition and error as in the like cases are either fit or
convenient,&rdquo; proceeds to instance some of these cautions
and guards; and the very first in the list is this, that the
ceremony in question is unessential.&nbsp; The &ldquo;vestments
are by none regarded as essential,&rdquo; and therefore abolish
them, says the Report.&nbsp; The sign of the Cross is
unessential, and therefore retain it, says the Canon.</p>
<p>Mark this a little more fully, for what can be more aptly
illustrative of the Commissioners&rsquo; argument?&nbsp; The
Canon does not merely confess and admit, but claims has an
advantage and reason for the retention of the usage, that it is
not in any way essential to the Sacrament of Baptism.&nbsp; So it
says, &ldquo;First, the Church of England, since the abolishing
of Papery, hath ever held and taught, and so doth hold and teach
still, that the sign of the Cross used in Baptism is no part of
the substance of that Sacrament: for when the Minister, dipping
the infant in water, or laying water upon the face of it, (as the
manner also is,) hath pronounced these words, <i>I baptize thee
in the Name of the Father</i>, <i>and of the Son</i>, <i>and of
the Holy Ghost</i>, the infant is fully and perfectly
baptized.&nbsp; So as the sign of the Cross, being afterwards
used, doth neither add any thing to the virtue and <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>perfection of
Baptism, nor being omitted, doth detract any thing from the
effect and substance thereof.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor is this all.&nbsp;
Another paragraph follows, insisting upon the same thing with a
second reason, shewing forth still the value of the ceremony,
though unessential.&nbsp; &ldquo;Secondly, it is apparent in the
Communion Book, that the infant baptized is, by virtue of
Baptism, before it is signed with the sign of the Cross, &amp;c.,
received into the congregation of Christ&rsquo;s flock, as a
perfect member thereof, and not by any power ascribed unto the
power of the Cross.&nbsp; So that, for the very remembrance of
the Cross, which is very precious unto all them who rightly
believe in Jesus Christ, and in the other respects mentioned, the
Church of England hath retained still the sign of it in Baptism;
following therein the primitive and Apostolical Churches, and
accounting it a lawful outward ceremony and honourable badge,
whereby the Infant is dedicated to the Service of Him that died
upon the Cross, as by the words used in the Book of Common Prayer
it may appear.&rdquo;&nbsp; This very confession, then, of its
being, first, no essential part of the Sacrament; nor, secondly,
essential to any one&rsquo;s being received as a perfect member
of Christ&rsquo;s flock;&mdash;is a safeguard and security, it is
argued, against any error or superstitious veneration of the sign
of the Cross, and so it ought, for its other values to be
retained.&nbsp; How near is this to what the Commissioners, upon
the evidence before them, might justly have said in relation to
the vestments; where in the indifferency of the ceremonial in
question they can only find an argument for restraint or
abolition.&nbsp; Surely they might not have been far wrong, on
the ground both of reason and Scriptural authority, had they,
after the pattern of the Canon, asserted the vesture in question
to be &ldquo;a lawful outward ceremony and honourable badge,
whereby&rdquo; more honour is intended and done &ldquo;unto the
Service of Him,&rdquo; and the blessed Sacrament of <i>His</i>
Body and Blood, &ldquo;that died upon the Cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Canon has yet another argument bearing upon the duty
of using (not abolishing) things indifferent (nonessentials in
other words) when ordered by the law of the Church.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lastly,&rdquo; it says, &ldquo;the use of the sign of the
<a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Cross in
Baptism being thus purged from all Popish superstition and error,
and reduced in the Church of England to the primary institution
of it, upon those true rules of doctrine concerning things
indifferent, which are consonant to the Word of God and the
judgment of all the ancient Fathers, we hold it the part of every
private man and other reverently to retain the true use of it
prescribed by public authority: considering that things
indifferent do in some sort alter their natures, when they are
either commanded or forbidden by a lawful magistrate; and may not
be omitted at every man&rsquo;s pleasure contrary to the law when
they be commanded, nor used, when they are
prohibited.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is there nothing here to justify such as
simply obey the authority of the Rubric?</p>
<p>There is a passage in the answers of the Bishops to the
Nonconformist divines at the Savoy Conference, which aptly
illustrates this statement of the Canon, and is of the more
moment because it shews that the mind of those who managed that
controversy in 1661 was entirely in harmony with that of the
framers of the Canons in 1603; and as the Savoy Conference was
the immediate precursor of the Convocation of the next year,
which in substance ratified and adopted its recommendations in
the last revision of our Prayer Book, those Episcopalian divines
may well be taken as the exponents of the mind of the very
Convocation which passed the Rubric upon ornaments.</p>
<p>We find the following among their replies to the objections of
the Nonconformists in relation to things indifferent in
themselves.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whereas the Nonconformists plead that
they cannot obey the commands of the Church for fear of violating
the precept which forbids adding to the Word of God (Deut. xii.
32): We answer, those Ministers do not well consider that it is
no addition to the Word of God to command things for order and
decency provided they are enjoined only as regulations of human
authority.&nbsp; And supposing some persons continue perplexed
and under scruples, the Church may, notwithstanding, without sin,
insist upon compliance with decent ceremonies; and all this
without being guilty of offending our weak brethren, for <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>here the
offence is <i>taken</i>, not <i>given</i>.&nbsp; It is the
prejudice and mistake of the scrupulous person that disturbs
himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; A somewhat more exact discrimination as to
causes of offence than the Commissioners seem to have
&ldquo;dreamed of in their philosophy!&rdquo;&nbsp; But the
Bishops of 1661 continue, &ldquo;Neither will the case of St.
Paul not eating flesh if it offended his weak brother give any
support to the objection.&nbsp; For here, it must be observed,
the Apostle speaks of things not commanded by God, or His Church,
of matters which had nothing of decency or significancy for
religious purposes, and therefore in a case thus unconnected with
Divine worship St. Paul was willing to resign his liberty rather
than offend his brother.&rdquo;&nbsp; Surely a remark not without
a very close significance in defence of those who are unwilling
to forego what they deem so important to the due celebration of
Divine Service, even though some are offended at it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But if any man should venture to break a just law or
custom of the Church, the Apostle marks him for a contentious
person (1 Cor. xi. 16).&rdquo;&nbsp; Has this no bearing upon
objectors now?&nbsp; And the Bishops continue, &ldquo;That these
ceremonies have occasioned many divisions, as it is pretended, is
no more their fault than the misunderstandings between the
nearest relations, accidentally consequent upon the preaching of
the Gospel (Luke xii.) can be fairly charged upon the Christian
religion.&rdquo; <a name="citation13"></a><a href="#footnote13"
class="citation">[13]</a>&nbsp; Have our present Commissioners
duly regarded all this in their hasty conclusion?</p>
<p>To sum up:&mdash;these arguments, if not pressed to the full
as to sin or fault in those who may not use or carry out a
prescribed ceremonial in all circumstances, such as, for
instance, long desuetude, may, at the very least, one would
think, be of sufficient weight defensively for such as have
merely obeyed the Law to prevent hard words being used either by
Royal Commissioners, or any others in high places, towards those,
I say, whose offence is merely that they have thus obeyed
it.&nbsp; And the fact of a ceremony, significant, though giving
offence, being thus prescribed by the Canon, and others of like
kind, contended for by the <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Savoy Episcopalian Divines, though
confessed to be <i>things indifferent</i>, gives a special
application of the whole to the one argument of the Commissioners
concerning the vestments being &ldquo;regarded by none as
essential.&rdquo;&nbsp; For let it be well observed that the
argument of the Canon is; This ceremony, the sign of the Cross,
though derided by Ethnics and Jews, is rejoiced in by the
Apostles; it begets a reverend estimation in regard to a
Sacrament: even the abuse of a thing doth not take away the
lawful use (no, not when the abuse has been by Rome).&nbsp; The
usage is indifferent, non-essential, in itself, and the
conclusion is, it is all the more to be retained.&nbsp; Moreover,
being ordered by lawful authority, it ought not to be made light
of, or objected to.&nbsp; In which principles the divines of the
Savoy Conference and the last revisers of our Prayer Book
agree.&nbsp; Surely, then, these authorities in all this are as
widely divergent from the views and reasoning of the Royal
Commissioners as east is from west, or black from white.&nbsp;
And the whole comparison teaches us much as to the value of their
one argument, which I have ventured to call a sophism, as to the
vestments being &ldquo;by none regarded as
essential.&rdquo;&nbsp; Moreover, if Bishop Sanderson&rsquo;s
remark is sound, that &ldquo;to take away the indifferency of
things indifferent is superstition,&rdquo; it will not be hard to
decide between those who reverently use, and those who bitterly
denounce, the vestments, which are the <i>superstitious</i>
persons in the present controversy.</p>
<p>But let us proceed to another point.&nbsp; I said, that even
when a thing or usage may be in itself not essential, yet the
liberty to use it may be highly essential, and this, in spite of
its giving grave offence to many.&nbsp; Take a brief illustration
of this.&nbsp; We all know there was a time when the marriage of
the clergy gave grave offence to many.&nbsp; Suppose at such
period a Royal Commission had been appointed to inquire into the
importance of the celibacy of the clergy.&nbsp; Say the
Commissioners had reported, &ldquo;We have examined many
witnesses, married and unmarried.&nbsp; We find considerable
difference of opinion.&nbsp; But we find that by none, even among
the married clergy, is the marriage of priests regarded as
essential to any priestly act, whilst their marriage gives grave
offence to many.&nbsp; We <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>are therefore of opinion that it is
expedient to enforce a greater uniformity of practice by
restraining the marriage of priests, and admitting no deviation
from what has been a long-established usage in the Church,
&amp;c. &amp;c.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now no one among us will deny the
fact of marriage being unessential to the functions of the
priesthood, and yet the liberty to marry may be very essential
indeed to the welfare of the Church.&nbsp; This liberty, for
&ldquo;Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, as for all other Christian
men, to marry at their own discretion, as they shall judge the
same to serve better to godliness,&rdquo; was at any rate thought
essential enough to be made the subject of one of our
Articles.&nbsp; And surely this may shew something as to the
weight to be attached to the one argument of the Commissioners,
for the &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; which they put out, and the
conclusion at which, on this sole basis, they arrive.</p>
<p>There is one point, further, which I should like briefly to
touch upon before leaving this matter of essential or
non-essential, for it shews how very carelessly or unscrupulously
the Commissioners have done their work, and made their
Report.&nbsp; The citation, which in its commencement they give
from the Commission appointing them, contains these words: that
&ldquo;it is expedient that a full and impartial enquiry should
be made into the matters aforesaid,&rdquo; viz. ornaments,
vestments, and such like, &ldquo;with the view of explaining or
amending the said rubrics, orders, and directions, so as to
secure general uniformity of practice <i>in such matters as are
essential</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation15"></a><a
href="#footnote15" class="citation">[15]</a>&nbsp; Now, observe,
by their own shewing, by the evidence they adduce, by the one
argument they advance, they recommend changes to secure a greater
uniformity in things which are <i>not essential</i>!&nbsp; Their
own very statement about these things, their sole ground on which
they form their opinion and base their recommendation, is, that
in regard to those witnesses whom they have examined, they (the
ornaments or vestments) are by none <i>regarded as
essential</i>.&nbsp; They accept and endorse this; and then, in
spite of the terms of their commission to enquire how to secure a
general uniformity of practice in <i>such </i><a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span><i>things as
are essential</i>, the only recommendation which they make is
upon that which they proclaim to be <i>unessential</i>, and what
is more, upon the very ground of its being <i>unessential</i>! <a
name="citation16"></a><a href="#footnote16"
class="citation">[16]</a></p>
<p><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>But
now, having considered the Commissioners&rsquo; one reason, and
their &ldquo;opinion,&rdquo; and their consequent recommendation,
we must come a little more particularly to examine their proposed
mode of operation.&nbsp; It is true they here become vague and
uncertain.&nbsp; They think &ldquo;it is expedient to restrain in
the public services of the Church all variations in respect of
vesture from that which has long been the established usage,
&amp;c.&rdquo; and, &ldquo;that this may be best secured by
providing aggrieved parishioners with an easy and effectual
process for complaint and redress.&rdquo;&mdash;(Report, p.
vii.)&nbsp; But as to the details of this provision, as to
&ldquo;the best <i>mode</i> of giving effect to these
conclusions,&rdquo; they are not yet prepared with their
scheme.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is all very natural, and it may be very
fortunate.&nbsp; We may be thankful that we have not a scheme
devised, to carry out their proposal, as crude as the proposal
and the Report itself.&nbsp; But though these details are not
before us, and we have a little respite before they come, we are
not without some indication as to what they are likely to be; and
we shall do well to use the time we have before they actually
take definite shape, in providing as far as possible to thwart
any pernicious principles which may be embodied in them.</p>
<p>Now I affirm, and I think I shall be able to shew, that the
remedy to be provided for the &ldquo;aggrieved
parishioner,&rdquo; by which he is to be enabled by law to make
complaint of, and obtain redress as to variations in respect of
vesture, (where being legal they yet displease him,) can
<i>only</i> be by an alteration in the Book of Common
Prayer.&nbsp; I am not saying, remember, that a due and a great
regard is not to be had for the feelings, and even the
prejudices, of our people; though it can hardly be denied that it
is very desirable these prejudices should be met, and these
feelings directed by careful enlightenment, into a more reverent
estimation of holy things, than prevailed some years since.&nbsp;
If the <i>usage</i> of Church ritual which reigned, say, thirty,
or forty, or fifty years ago, had been stereotyped at any time as
that which should be established for ever in our Church, we
should certainly have had a state of things perpetuated which
most <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>of us
would now regard as an immense spiritual misfortune, and at which
we should be wholly ashamed and grieved.&nbsp; But what we have
to consider in relation to this Report is not at all this regard,
on the part of the clergy, for the feelings of their people, but
the putting into their hands a positive and express legal process
of remedy and restraint, where any change from long-established
custom, however accordant with the law, is proposed to be
adopted.&nbsp; And I say unhesitatingly, that such redress,
redress of such a nature, for the so-called &ldquo;aggrieved
parishioner,&rdquo; can only be by a repeal of the Rubric.&nbsp;
This surely is plain on the very face of the matter.&nbsp; For
the Prayer Book gives the law (Church Law and State Law in one)
as to what vesture or ornament shall be used; and what power on
earth can give the aggrieved parishioner a right or power to
interfere with this law, as much statute law as any other thing
in the statute book, but the repeal of the law?&nbsp; There is no
other conceivable mode.&nbsp; What can restrain a priest from
complying with the law of his Church and the law of the land?
what can make it penal to obey it, but the repeal of the said
law?&nbsp; This may be done directly or indirectly.&nbsp; It may
be done explicitly or implicitly; but done it must be if any one
or any number of aggrieved parishioners are to be empowered to
restrain their parish priest from, not, observe, the mere impulse
of his own fancy, but from an obedience to that which is the law
of his Church, and the statute law of the land, as laid down in
the Prayer Book.</p>
<p>This seems evident enough in the very nature of things.&nbsp;
And therefore if we value the Prayer Book as it is, and the
<i>status</i> of the Church of England as in such large measure
depending upon it, we have every right, and more than the right,
the duty, to be up and stirring to defend it, under the assault
upon its integrity which this, the present Report,
threatens.&nbsp; Indeed, under such intimations as we have, where
&ldquo;coming events cast their shadows before,&rdquo; it seems
to me that it would be absolute infatuation to wait until the
attack is more matured, and the danger nearer, before organizing
every mode and means of defence <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>and resistance to that which is
already so obviously impending.</p>
<p>But we are not even left to our own mere reasoning, or natural
anticipations, to guide us to the mode in which the Commissioners
must be prepared to carry out their opinion and
recommendation.&nbsp; We have a light thrown upon this, in a
lucid commentary upon the bare Report, furnished us by one of the
Commissioners.&nbsp; I have already alluded to it.&nbsp; The
recent Charge of the Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol not only
deals with the question of Ritual itself, but specifically, in
relation to it, with the modes in which the recommendation of the
Report may be carried out; and I will venture to affirm, even in
the face of his Lordship&rsquo;s disclaimer as to the mode which
he himself advocates being an alteration in the Prayer Book, that
there is not one of the courses suggested (except the course of
leaving the matter to the decision of the Courts, which he at
once rejects,) that does not involve a repeal, direct or
indirect, of the rubric upon ornaments.&nbsp; It will not be
alien from, but indeed very much to, our purpose to take his
statements in some detail, and see what they indicate as to the
likely progress of the Commissioners&rsquo; work.&nbsp; Bishop
Ellicott&rsquo;s Charge in this relation is very important, for
it cannot but give us the key to what he at least will press upon
his brother Commissioners when again they meet, and perhaps is
now pressing upon them.</p>
<p>Let us turn to the Charge, and mark both its general tone and
specific recommendations as to high Ritual.&nbsp; Having adverted
to the &ldquo;deteriorating developement of the Ritual
movement,&rdquo; he says: <a name="citation19"></a><a
href="#footnote19"
class="citation">[19]</a>&mdash;&ldquo;Reluctant as I am to enter
upon a subject of such difficulty and controversy, yet I feel it
my clear duty to place succinctly before you the present state of
the question, to endeavour dispassionately to estimate the real
amount and extent of the <i>evil</i>&rdquo; (Bishop Ellicott has
no doubts as to this term); &ldquo;and, lastly, to consider the
remedies that have been proposed, and the general counsel that
may seem at this serious crisis most calculated <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>to bring back
peace to our now disquieted Church.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, after an
historical sketch, with remarks, shewing his lordship&rsquo;s
feelings upon the subject, and a brief&mdash;almost, as it seems
to me, a needless&mdash;apology for the bishops for not having
put down with a quick and strong hand certain presumably
<i>legal</i> ornaments or usages, he proceeds to consider what
may be done in the way of remedy for the <i>evil</i>, as he deems
it, of Ritual representing doctrine, in the following
terms:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us now,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;leave the past, and
with the past all antagonisms and recriminations, and rather as
calm, earnest, and loyal sons of the Reformed Church of England,
confer together as to what now remains to be done.&nbsp; Let us
soberly and dispassionately consider what measures seem wisest,
what remedies most hopeful, at the present momentous
crisis.&nbsp; Let us clear the ground by considering briefly some
courses and remedies that have already been proposed, and that
probably will be reiterated with pertinacity.&nbsp; One proposed
remedy is, the simple omission of the Ornaments&rsquo; Rubric as
in the Irish Book of Common Prayer; or its definite and express
repeal by some legislative measure.&nbsp; This is a prompt
remedy, but a dangerous one&mdash;dangerous in part from reasons
already adduced, in part from the deep and rankling bitterness
arising from the thus greatly increased conviction that the law
is really in favour of the use of vestments, and being so is to
be overridden by an unjust Act of Parliament.&nbsp; Two courses
are always dangerous in this country; one is to leave in the
hearts of any party an enduring sense of injustice, a ready
political illustration of which is perhaps at once rising in the
thoughts of many of us; the other is, to come in direct conflict
with that constitutional principle which is embodied in the
familiar and traditional &lsquo;<i>Nolumus leges Angli&aelig;
mutari</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; We cannot, then, I think, wisely adopt
the remedy just mentioned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I imagine few of us will be disposed to question the justice
of these remarks, or to quarrel with the dismissal of this first
proposed mode of remedy.&nbsp; But next he mentions another
course, in these terms:&mdash;&ldquo;Still less wise should <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>we be to
adopt another but very dissimilar remedy that has been pressed
upon us, and will probably be pressed upon us with continued
earnestness.&nbsp; This remedy may be considered as summed up in
the following formula:&mdash;&lsquo;Arm your bishops with more
power, and then leave it to their Fatherly wisdom to allow or
disallow these innovations according to the peculiarities of the
case.&rsquo;&nbsp; In plainer words, let the bishop become,
instead of the administrator of the law, the manipulator of the
law; and let a want of reasonable uniformity, now dangerously
great, be multiplied tenfold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Observe here, before we proceed further, that this power of
manipulation, over and above being open to the objection which
the Bishop notices of multiplying diversities of practice, is in
fact nothing else than setting the bishop above the law as it
exists, and is, therefore, as we said all these remedies would be
found to be, a repeal of the rubric which is the present
law.&nbsp; But at any rate, here again, the Bishop rejects the
proposed mode of action, though, he says, we should
&ldquo;pause&rdquo; upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On this remedy it is necessary to pause.&nbsp; Every
clear-headed man among us must see, in the first place, that it
is giving to bishops a power which they have never even attempted
to exercise, except in the unsettled times which immediately
followed the Reformation; secondly, that our dioceses would
exhibit varieties of usage dependent on the general views and
convictions of the bishop for the time being, and liable to be
altered when a successor came into his place; thirdly, that men
of advanced opinions would make every effort to get into the
diocese of that bishop who might be supposed, rightly or wrongly,
most to favour them&mdash;and, when there, would exercise a
combined pressure which would be very difficult to resist;
fourthly, and lastly, that, after all, this is but an ingenious
expedient to postpone that settlement of the question which
common sense and common foresight now perceive to be
inevitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without endorsing the concluding remark of the Bishop&rsquo;s
comment, we may say that with great justice he condemns the
remedy, though not expressly upon the ground which I <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>have
mentioned as the strongest&mdash;viz., its setting the bishop
above the law, and so altering the Prayer Book.&nbsp; He adds,
however, something more as to a modification of the plan of
giving more power to the bishops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may, then, I think, fairly dismiss this proposed
remedy as even less hopeful than the first.&nbsp; But there is a
sort of phase and form of it, a kind of intermediate course,
which deserves more consideration.&nbsp; The proposed measure
would be of this kind&mdash;to give the bishop not only power to
restrain, but to require him to stop, all Ritualistic
innovations, more especially in regard of vestments, whenever he
might be appealed to by a certain number of trustworthy
parishioners.&nbsp; The effect of this, of course, would be to
leave things alone where no complaint was preferred, the
justifying grounds being the uncertainty of the law on the one
side, and the deliberate preference shown by the parishioners for
the mode of conducting public worship then prevailing.&nbsp; No
doubt this, in some degree, helps us over the plain difficulty we
must expect to meet with in those cases where Ritualistic
practices have prevailed for some time unopposed.&nbsp; We must
not disguise from ourselves that it will be extremely difficult
to bring back to simpler forms of worship a minister and a
congregation that have not only been accustomed to, but
deliberately prefer, much more ornate forms; the putting off of
these vestments will, in some cases, involve much more difficulty
and trouble than their original introduction.&nbsp; It is human
nature to cling tenaciously to what is distinctive, and this
deposition of the distinctive will be complicated by the assumed
close connection between the vestment and the doctrine.&nbsp; All
these great and real difficulties we have before us, and we may
feel at first inclined to favour that which seems to reduce their
dimensions, but I do venture to think here again that the dangers
likely to arise from thus practically leaving the matter
unsettled, and still more from the local discords that would be
sure to arise during the constant attempts that would be made to
bring the prohibitory bishop in some way or other on the scene,
and the sad divisions that would follow if the attempt
succeeded&mdash;<a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>all these things, I fear, must lead us to decide against
a remedy, which, while saving us from some immediate
difficulties, would bequeath to us and to our children a heritage
of future difficulties and dangers far exceeding both in number
and degree the difficulties and dangers of the
present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is much truth in these objections, but the most potent
objection of all is, that here, again, as in all other modes
proposed by way of remedy, there is the real and tangible repeal
of the Rubric; so an alteration of the Prayer Book, and a
manifest change in the <i>status</i> of the Church and of
Churchmen.</p>
<p>The Bishop next touches upon another plan, which indeed is not
a mode of remedy (in the sense of making a change to meet the
difficulty) at all, which therefore does not lie open to the same
objection.&nbsp; The Bishop, indeed, dismisses it at once as
hopeless and useless, though it remains to be seen whether it
really be so.&nbsp; I mean the due interpretation of the law by
the courts of law; which being done, to let the law alone, and
the Prayer Book alone, and the Church alone.&nbsp; However he
continues;&mdash;&ldquo;But, lastly, it may be said, is all hope
entirely past of finally settling the question by an appeal to
the law courts, and thence to that highest tribunal that has
already had the impleaded rubric before it, though under a
somewhat different point of view?&nbsp; Yes, I fear we must now
say that all hope is finally past.&nbsp; The knot cannot now be
laboriously untied; it must be removed by gentle drawing out on
either side, or&mdash;it must be cut.&nbsp; In the first place,
the country at large would not now be content to wait for what
experience has shewn might be a long-delayed issue.&nbsp; It
would be urged that such delay would only aid the progress of
innovation, and that now when a Commission has been appointed and
has not recommended a reference to law courts, it would be a
practical retracing of steps that would seriously add to our
present disquietude.&nbsp; To which we may subjoin this
comment&mdash;that even if a speedy reference to the ultimate
tribunal (by some thought possible) could be secured, the
decision now, after the startling evidence <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>given before
the Commission, would not, it is to be feared, whichever way it
might be, bring to us all the blessing of peace and
settlement.&nbsp; If it were <i>for</i> the Ritualists, a prompt
effort would be made to set aside the rubric by legislation; and
then bitterness, struggle, and all the evils above alluded to, in
connection with a sense of injustice, would at once be in
malignant working among us.&nbsp; If it were <i>against</i> the
Ritualists, I now sadly fear, after the painful language publicly
used by many of them against those in authority, and the
disregard of the Convocation Resolutions of last year, that they
would decline to submit to the decision, force unwilling men to
put the law in action against them, accept the issue, and leave
the communion of the Reformed Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is much here from which I cannot do other than express
most strongly my dissent; for&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Why should the rabid violence of all that is
uncatholic and unbelieving in the country be taken to be the
voice of the country to which heed is to be given?&nbsp; The
Canon before quoted, when it speaks of offending the minds of
men, is careful to say &ldquo;the minds of sober men;&rdquo; but
here it seems that all which is most violent, unreasoning, and
intemperate, is to be accepted as the mind of the country from
which there is no appeal.&nbsp; Nay, more, as is evident, this
temper is hounded on to be even more violent and rabid, by such
unseemly deference to its clamour, and by the pusillanimous
assertion that law and order must be overridden because the
impatience of such minds will not be content even to wait till
the law courts have spoken.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Why should we not wait, if it be needful to wait, in
order to determine with all due care and deliberation what the
law is upon the main points brought into controversy&mdash;what
it allows and what it disallows?&nbsp; This tremendous
impatience, this overwhelming desire for exterminating obnoxious
Ritual and Ritualists, this awe-struck terror that if these men,
and their practices, and their teaching be only given fair play,
their opponents of the uncatholic school will be defeated, and be
found to have clamoured for illegal restraints&mdash;all this is
surely the most wonderful admission <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>against themselves and their cause,
which men even pretending to seek truth and right could possibly
make, and one least likely to commend their cause and mode of
action to any just and honest mind.&nbsp; Hear a few words upon
this head from a venerable Archdeacon (<i>venerabilis</i> not
merely by station and age, but by learning and Christian wisdom
also), one of whom England may well be proud.&nbsp; In the
<i>Guardian</i> of November 6 you will find a letter from
Archdeacon Churton, enforcing with very great weight
Gamaliel&rsquo;s advice, &ldquo;Let these men alone,&rdquo; at
the present momentous crisis.&nbsp; Allow me to read a few lines
from it.&nbsp; He says:&mdash;&ldquo;The advice which alone can
save the Church from a new schism is plainly Gamaliel&rsquo;s
advice.&nbsp; I am very sorry that so many of our present
bishops, younger men than myself, are averse from it, or uttering
uncertain sounds which I could never adopt without suspecting my
own magnanimity.&nbsp; It is to be regretted that they do not
rather seek to guide a movement which has in it too many elements
of good to be rudely condemned; and that they do not speak first
of vindicating the law before they alter it.&nbsp; On the
contrary, however, they seem to contemplate a new statute to
establish, as if of perpetual obligation, certain vestments
invented by clerical tailors of the last century, at which S.
Ambrose would have stood aghast. . . .&nbsp; One of our sacred
legislators has declared himself above all things anxious not to
allow the Ritualists time to plead their cause with the
public.&nbsp; It was the praise of Bishop Henry Spencer in King
Richard&rsquo;s time, according to Walsingham, that he gave the
Lollards the shortest possible shrift-time for coming to their
senses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a passage much to the same purport which will well
repay perusal in the late Essay on &ldquo;The Law of
Ritualism,&rdquo; by the Bishop of Vermont, the Presiding Bishop
of the United States, from which several extracts are given in
one of the Appendices to the Commissioners&rsquo; Report.&nbsp;
Consider the following passage in reference to the unjust
impatience of the day, and the plea for the allowance of fair
time to test the merits of the question.&nbsp; His remarks are
directed no doubt in the first instance to America, but <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>there is
nothing to confine the reasoning to America alone.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Time,&rdquo; says the Bishop, &ldquo;and nothing but time,
can decide the question whether an increase of Ritualism is
advisable, or whether the present average of parochial practice
is best fitted to carry on the work of the Church in such a
country as ours.&nbsp; I doubt whether any man can estimate with
sufficient accuracy the various elements which belong to such a
subject so as to form anything like a <i>positive</i>
opinion.&nbsp; Success after all must be the ultimate
standard.&nbsp; And that can only be determined <i>by time</i>,
<i>after a fair trial</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation26"></a><a
href="#footnote26" class="citation">[26]</a>&nbsp; The Bishop
proceeds to give his opinion, however, upon the matter, which is
well worthy of our consideration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am willing, however, to state my <i>impressions</i>,
and the reader may take them for what they may be worth,
according to his own judgment.&nbsp; I incline, then, to regard
it as most <i>probable</i> that this Ritualism will grow in
favour by degrees until it becomes the prevailing system.&nbsp;
The old, the fixed, and the fearful will resist it; but the
young, the ardent, and the impressible will follow it more and
more.&nbsp; The spirit of the age will favour it, because it is
an age of excitement and sensation; the lovers of &lsquo;glory
and of beauty&rsquo; will favour it, because it appeals with far
more effect to the natural tastes and feelings of humanity; the
rising generation of the clergy will favour it, because it adds
so much to the solemn character of their office, and the interest
of their service in the House of God.&nbsp; And the opposition
arising from its resemblance to Romanism will die away, as men
learn to understand that Popery does not consist in the Ritualism
which it pleased the Lord to order for His own chosen people, but
in Papal and priestly despotism, in false doctrine, in the
worship of the Virgin and the Saints, in Purgatory and
Indulgences, in Transubstantiation and pretended miracles, in
persecution and intolerance, and in all the other perilous
corruptions which are in direct conflict with the unerring Word
of God.&nbsp; These, and not matters of mere Ritual, are properly
<a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>Romanism;
and these, and only these, called for the work of
Reformation.&rdquo; <a name="citation27a"></a><a
href="#footnote27a" class="citation">[27a]</a></p>
<p>I cannot resist the temptation to add a few words more from
the Bishop&rsquo;s work, so aptly do they meet many of the
popular prejudices and fallacies pervading the unreflecting or
intolerant public mind at the present time.&nbsp; After some
excellent remarks upon the symbolism of the ministerial garments,
their adoption under Divine command in the old dispensation, and
their naturally passing from the Jews to &ldquo;the Gentiles on
the strongest ground of Scriptural consistency,&rdquo; he adds,
&ldquo;there are many good and respectable Christians in our day
who regard this matter of distinctive ministerial garments with
contempt, and sometimes even with positive aversion, because they
look upon it as one of the corruptions of Romanism.&nbsp; But the
ancient Church of God is not to be regarded with contempt by any
man who professes to believe the Bible.&nbsp; That sacred
institution was Divine, and was given by the Almighty Himself to
His own chosen and peculiar people.&nbsp; None but a fool would
say that the Church of the Jews had any connection with the
system of Popery.&nbsp; Nor will any sensible man pretend that
the Reformation of the 16th century was occasioned by the dress
or ecclesiastical order of the Church of Rome; which are in no
respect more splendid or imposing than the usages of the Oriental
Churches.&rdquo; <a name="citation27b"></a><a href="#footnote27b"
class="citation">[27b]</a></p>
<p>And, further on, after having examined various points of
evidence as to the principles and law of the Church of England in
the matter, he adds, &ldquo;to my mind, therefore, the legal
position of our English brethren in this matter of Ritualism is
justifiable as to its main design, and stands on a far higher
ground of Scripture, law, and reason, than that of their
adversaries.&nbsp; So long as the great doctrines of the
Reformation are faithfully preached by the clergy I can see no
danger that a solemn, rich, and attractive ritual will <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>ever lead any
one to Popery.&nbsp; Is it not more reasonable to believe that
the restoration of the old ceremonial which existed in the second
year of Edward VI. would give our Church the advantage which now
forms the most alluring characteristic of Rome? . . .&nbsp; Has
not truth as good a right as falsehood to be adorned with
beauty?&nbsp; And is it to be questioned that religion should
favourably affect the senses, in order that it may better reach
the soul?&rdquo; <a name="citation28a"></a><a href="#footnote28a"
class="citation">[28a]</a></p>
<p>3.&nbsp; But, to return more directly to Bishop Ellicott; I
must enter my protest against, and state my most absolute
disbelief in, the correctness of his opinion as to the last
danger indicated in the passage last quoted from his Charge, as
to what would be the conduct of the ritualistic clergy under a
legal settlement of points in dispute. <a
name="citation28b"></a><a href="#footnote28b"
class="citation">[28b]</a>&nbsp; It may be, indeed, that if
judgment should go in favour of the Ritualists their opponents
would be stirred up to any conceivable pitch of madness; but I
must wholly disclaim all belief that the great mass of those who
have adopted a high ritual would do other than accept the
decision of the law courts, if duly arrived at.&nbsp; Even with
our present most unsatisfactory Court of Final Appeal, I should
expect this, though it might be under protest; but I do not
believe they would refuse to submit to the decision, I mean as to
ceremonial, or persist in usages declared to be not warranted by
the present law of the Church.&nbsp; It would, of course, be
another thing if any attempt were made to tie up their hands, or
shut their mouth, as to doctrine; but in regard merely to
ceremonial I do not believe they would justify the Bishop&rsquo;s
confident prediction, &ldquo;force unwilling men to put the law
in action against them, accept the issue, and leave the communion
of the Reformed Church.&rdquo;&nbsp; I do not believe this for a
moment as the effect of a legal decision, duly given, or as duly
as it can be at present, as to what the law really is; dealing
only, I say, in its terms, with ceremonial, even though we should
all perceive, it may be, that it had a connection with
doctrine.&nbsp; Still this would not be the making a new
doctrine, but only declaring that <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>the law of ceremonies was less
favourable to the expression by symbolism or otherwise of certain
doctrines than it had been supposed to be.&nbsp; This, I think,
they would endure.&nbsp; What might be their conduct, if you
alter the law on purpose to catch them when they were not
offenders under it; if you <i>change</i> the Book of Common
Prayer in an uncatholic direction, in a matter touching doctrine;
if you do this for a party purpose, and to uncatholicize the
Church of England, I do not pretend to say.&nbsp; I will venture
no prophecy as to what some might be led to do under such an
aggravated condition of injustice.&nbsp; I do not myself say, I
do not myself think, that they ought, even then, to &ldquo;accept
the issue, and leave the communion of the Reformed
Church.&rdquo;&nbsp; But it needs no ghost to tell us that such
action taken on the uncatholic side would be a step towards
making catholic-minded men <i>despair</i> of the Church of
England; and if England&rsquo;s Convocations and Legislature
should do this, you may well judge, my friends, if they will not
have gone near with many to sever the last strand of the rope
which held them to her.&nbsp; No man, I will venture to say,
leaves her till he despairs of her; and to alter the Prayer Book
in a Puritan direction, and for a Puritan purpose, directly at
the bidding and for the interest of Puritan innovators, is
unquestionably the way to make men despair of her.&nbsp; And
awful, indeed, must be the responsibility of any one who has any
hand or takes any part in so doing!</p>
<p>But Bishop Ellicott comes next to the scheme of which he
himself approves, not indeed as free from all difficulty, but as
the best mode which he can think of to relieve the
&ldquo;Aggrieved Parishioner;&rdquo; and as one which he imagines
to be free from the imputation of repealing any part of the
Prayer Book.&nbsp; We must give the proposal in his own
words.&nbsp; Having, as we have seen, rejected all the former
plans mentioned, he says:&mdash;&ldquo;We are thus flung back on
the difficult question: Is there any other course or measure that
may still be suggested, and that can with any degree of hope be
followed, in the present emergency?&nbsp; In attempting to answer
the serious question, we must obviously base our answer on the
sober and considerate Report of the Royal <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>Commission,
and test it by its degree of accordance with the two clearly
defined principles of that Report.&nbsp; The two principles
are&mdash;<i>First</i>, that it is expedient to <i>restrain</i>
all variations in respect of vesture from what has <i>long</i>
been the established usage, on account of the grave offence so
given to many; <i>Secondly</i>, that aggrieved
<i>parishioners</i> ought to be provided with an easy and
effectual process of complaint and redress.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
noticing that the Report makes &ldquo;an inferential but
important recognition of the fact that the innovators are of two
classes&mdash;the one regarding the vestments as symbolical of
<i>doctrine</i>, the other as furthering a desire to do
<i>honour</i> to the highest act of Christian worship&rdquo;
(which after all seems to be a false division, for those who
desire to do this honour to the highest act of Christian worship
consider it, I apprehend, to be the highest act of Christian
worship, and are anxious to pay it this honour <i>on account</i>
of the doctrine), the Bishop proceeds,&mdash;&ldquo;The two
parties do not agree in the view they take of the meaning and
design of Eucharistic vestments, but they do agree in the
admission that they are not essential to the Sacrament.&nbsp; As,
then, that which is admitted to be not essential is certainly an
innovation on prevailing custom, and being so certainly does give
grave offence, it surely must be pronounced right, fair, and
reasonable, calmly and considerately, but still firmly, to
restrain the innovation, at any rate until further order be taken
by authority, even though the innovation may be able to plead to
the letter of a law long ago left in abeyance, and practically
abrogated by custom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not unworthy here of remark how we have again
cropping-up the old story of the vestments being &ldquo;not
essential to the Sacrament,&rdquo; and &ldquo;giving grave
offence;&rdquo; the fallacy and one-sidedness of which one
argument of the Commissioners, I trust, I have already shewn in
both its parts.&nbsp; After some words further on the doctrine
symbolized, on the conduct of the clergy who use the vestments,
and on the not unnatural &ldquo;fears in some minds that the
settlement of the English Church of two hundred years ago is
about to be changed&rdquo; (and truly here he has &ldquo;harped
our fear aright&rdquo;), he goes on to express his desire for an
effectual <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>restraint.&nbsp; &ldquo;But we must not less recognize
the plain fact that there is a sad and pressing necessity now
laid upon us by prevailing licence, anarchy, and I fear
disloyalty, to restrain; and that now restraint <i>must</i> be
applied.&nbsp; We must, then, solemnly ask those true hearts who
may deprecate, not for themselves, but for what they may deem the
interests of the Church, any authoritative application of
restraint, to suspend for a time even their own innocent longings
and predilections, to acknowledge with us the overwhelming nature
of the necessity, and to join cordially and hopefully, not the
side of recklessness, scornfulness, and self-will, but the side
of recognition of rightful authority, moderation, and
order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brave words, indeed, as you shall see in a
summer&rsquo;s day,&rdquo; but as it seems to me wholly
misapplied, when it is remembered that the &ldquo;recklessness,
scornfulness, and self-will,&rdquo; attributed to the Ritualistic
clergy have never, so far as I am aware, or as I think is borne
out by evidence, gone further than this, that they have
temperately and respectfully objected to any
&ldquo;manipulators&rdquo; being placed above the law, and asked
to be allowed in quiet to obey what they believe the law to
require; where, too, to speak generally, they have found such
obedience to the law to be acceptable to the mass of their
people, or even demanded by them; whilst, upon the other hand,
the whole violence of opposition and clamour (again to speak
generally) has been exhibited by those who have not belonged to
the parishes or churches where such ceremonial has been in use,
but who have chosen gratuitously to interfere in order to prevent
others, with whom really they had nothing at all to do, having
such a Ritual, believed to be within the four corners of the law,
as by them was desired, and to them was edifying.</p>
<p>And now we come to the proposal itself&mdash;this remedy to
meet so great an evil.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lastly, then, if there is to
be this restraint, what will seem to be the safest and most
effectual mode of applying it?&nbsp; Certainly not, as I have
already said, by merely arming bishops with a little more power,
and then leaving the whole question in its present unsettled
state to be adjusted by individual authority and <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>individual
bias; nor yet again, as I have already said, by the omission or
authoritative repeal of a rubric that has held its place in our
Prayer Book from the date of the last settlement; but <i>by a
simple and positive enactment declaring what shall be</i>, <i>and
be considered to be</i>, <i>the ministerial dress</i>&mdash;until
further order be taken.&nbsp; This, of course, must be by direct
legislation.&nbsp; We may shrink from it, but in my judgment it
is now inevitable.&nbsp; The very appointment of the Commission
seems to involve it, and the general temper of the country will
demand it.&nbsp; There are many melancholy signs that we are fast
drifting towards open violations of the public peace, and that
some prompt interposition of law will not only be desirable but
imperative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Observe here the course proposed, and the marvellous
declaration concerning it, that it is &ldquo;not a repeal of the
rubric which has held its place in our Prayer Book from the date
of the last settlement.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet the remedy is &ldquo;a
simple and positive enactment (by direct legislation) declaring
what shall be, and shall be considered to be, the ministerial
dress&mdash;until further order be taken.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is
the remedy; and after details as to what it would prohibit, or at
least allow to be prohibited (which would include all now
distinctly contended for under the rubric on ornaments), the
Bishop says, &ldquo;<i>the rubric would not be repealed</i>,
<i>but placed in abeyance</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the special
point to which I desire to draw your attention!&nbsp; Such a plan
to be adopted, such restraint to be put in force and imposed; and
the rubric not to be repealed! the Prayer Book not to be
altered!&nbsp; Imagine anyone after this &ldquo;simple and
positive enactment&rdquo; acting upon the rubric, using the
things &ldquo;prescribed,&rdquo; or &ldquo;in use by the
authority of Parliament in the second year of King Edward
VI.,&rdquo; and then being proceeded against under the new
Act.&nbsp; Would he not soon learn whether the rubric were not
repealed?&nbsp; What will lawyers say?&nbsp; What does
common-sense say on the matter?&nbsp; What would those who
believed the Bishop (ill-starred mortals), that the rubric was
not repealed, find and feel to their cost, when his assurance had
led them to believe the law of the Church remains as it is?</p>
<p><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>Take a
case in illustration.&nbsp; Say you treated thus the Decalogue,
or any part of it.&nbsp; Take the Sixth, Seventh, or Eighth
Commandments: suppose you left them to be printed in the Prayer
Book still; but by &ldquo;a simple and positive enactment&rdquo;
set men free from obedience to them, or rather prohibited
obedience to them, until further order be taken.&nbsp; Would they
be thus repealed so far as human enactment goes, or would the
Prayer Book still remain unchanged in respect to them?&nbsp; Or,
still better, look to the Fourth Commandment&mdash;I say better,
because the others are negative, and this is positive.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath Day.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Grant that it were still permitted to be printed in the Prayer
Book, and recited in church; but then that there were &ldquo;a
simple and positive enactment&rdquo; restraining men from keeping
it holy; prescribing and requiring a uniformity of work,
according to custom widely prevailing, reminding us that a
careful observance of the Lords Day had become obsolete; that
long custom to the contrary had abrogated the usage, and now it
was expedient to restrain it.&nbsp; Would this be no
alteration?&nbsp; Would this be no repeal of the Decalogue, or
change in the Prayer Book?&nbsp; Oh! but the Bishop says the
restraint is only &ldquo;until further order be
taken.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, what is the force of this?&nbsp;
Whatever hope it may hold out in the future, is it any
<i>qualification</i> even, for the present?&nbsp; Surely
not.&nbsp; Whilst the &ldquo;simple and positive enactment&rdquo;
lasts, the former law is repealed.&nbsp; Besides, how much hope
does it hold out, even for the future?&nbsp; If the
Bishop&rsquo;s temper and counsel are to prevail, I must affirm
<i>none</i>.&nbsp; For we have seen that not merely the more
violent enemies of Ritual, but even the Bishop himself, whom we
must assume to represent its more moderate opponents, I say he
himself is <i>not for waiting</i> to give those who are certainly
more nearly maintaining and obeying the law than those who
clamour against them, even the chance of making good their
position in the eye and mind of England.&nbsp; He will not do
this at present, when there is at least a fair presumption that
in the main the law is in their favour, but he will hold them out
a dim hope of something turning up propitiously <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>for them in
the future; when he has thrown all his weight and influence into
the scale against them, and when, if he can have his way, he will
pass a &ldquo;simple and positive enactment&rdquo; to condemn
them, and alter adversely their <i>status</i> in the
Church!&nbsp; He will have them put down now with the strong
hand, by legislation framed expressly and on purpose to catch
them for their obedience to the existing law; but they may
console themselves with the thought that &ldquo;all contemplation
of a future when further order might be taken concerning the
questions now under consideration would not be authoritatively
excluded.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, put the consolation at its best;
make what you may of it; avoid, if you can, bitterly laughing at
such a mockery of hope.&nbsp; But even then, turn to the state of
things if such an enactment take place; &ldquo;a simple and
positive enactment,&rdquo; forbidding such &ldquo;ornaments of
the Church and ministers thereof&rdquo; to be used &ldquo;as were
in use by the authority of Parliament in the second year of King
Edward VI.;&rdquo; and I ask again (for this is our real and
great question) What would be the condition of the Book of Common
Prayer?&nbsp; Would it be what it is now, or would it be
changed?&nbsp; Would the present rule be &ldquo;in
abeyance&rdquo;&mdash;that is, much unused, but still the
law&mdash;or would it be repealed?&nbsp; What is the difference
between the proposed remedy and repeal?&nbsp; It would be as if
you made &ldquo;a simple and positive enactment&rdquo; that,
&ldquo;until further order,&rdquo; no man should be arrested for
debt; no man taken up for theft or violence; no man prosecuted
for treason; no man hanged for murder.&nbsp; You may call this,
abeyance of the law in those cases, but it is a misuse of the
term.&nbsp; A thing is <i>in abeyance</i> which for any cause
happens to be <i>disused</i>, not when it is by enactment
<i>forbidden to be used</i>; as a title <i>is in abeyance</i>,
not when there is no heir (in which case it is <i>extinct</i>),
but when the heir is unknown, or the pretensions of two or more
claimants undetermined; when the heir is not <i>forbidden</i>, as
the heir, to take it if he <i>be</i> the heir, but only whilst
there may be doubt whether he be the heir or not.&nbsp; But here,
it is assumed by the very act of legislation that something is
known to be the law, so that <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>you despair of getting rid of it but
by altering the law; and therefore that, though it is known to be
the law, and for the very reason that it is known to be the law,
it is to be prohibited and excluded.&nbsp; Can any man in his
senses be made to believe that this is not repeal?</p>
<p>I think, sir, I need go no further as to proving that all
these schemes, and this last just as much as the rest (all except
the letting the courts of law settle what is the law, and then
abiding by it), agree fully in this one point that they tamper
with and alter our Book of Common Prayer.</p>
<p>And all this, over and above the reason and common-sense of
the matter, tells us what the next Report of the Ritual
Commission will be, unless the Commissioners be duly impressed
with the danger of the course which they are pursuing, and the
enormous responsibility of trying to carry it out.</p>
<p>And this brings me to a further practical point, which it is
very fitting that I should lay before you.&nbsp; I mean the
resistance proposed to all alteration in the Prayer Book by means
of the public meeting so lately held in London; and the action to
be taken in connection with the resolutions then passed as to
memorializing the Royal Commissioners upon the subject.</p>
<p>There appears to be a curious piece of evidence that the great
meeting in St. James&rsquo;s Hall has even already not been
wholly unproductive of results.&nbsp; That meeting was held on
Tuesday, the 19th of November.&nbsp; The <i>Times</i> was
singularly quiescent in relation to it for nearly a week: but
yesterday, Nov. 26, in an article upon Lord Portman&rsquo;s
questions in the House of Lords touching the Bishop of
Salisbury&rsquo;s Charge&mdash;though not dealing directly with
the meeting&mdash;it yet introduces the following apposite
remarks:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is alike extremely difficult and extremely dangerous
to alter our existing formularies, but it would be perfectly
possible, and that, as the Bishop of London said, without any
very sweeping alterations, to simplify the course of procedure in
our Ecclesiastical Courts.&nbsp; It seems to be generally felt
that all classes of the clergy should be more amenable to the
public than they have been; and it will <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>certainly be
better, as well as more practicable, to attempt in the first
place to effect this result, rather by an improvement in the
administration of the law than in the law itself.&rdquo; <a
name="citation36"></a><a href="#footnote36"
class="citation">[36]</a>&nbsp; Is it straining matters too much
to think that we have in this no mean tribute to the justice of
the objects and views of the meeting at St. James&rsquo;s
Hall?</p>
<p>And here it may not be amiss to say one word upon the
principle of a Memorial to such a body as the Royal
Commission.&nbsp; I believe there are some who think it improper
to memorialize the Commissioners, as if it were like petitioning
a judge to convict or acquit a prisoner placed upon his trial
before him.&nbsp; Of course, if the cases were parallel, it would
be most improper and indecent.&nbsp; But a moment&rsquo;s
reflection will shew the difference.&nbsp; The Commission is not
a court of justice at all.&nbsp; It has no judicial functions at
all.&nbsp; There is no more objection to memorializing it than
there is to petitioning Parliament.&nbsp; It is a body of men
appointed to collect evidence, and afterwards to give an opinion
as to what is expedient.&nbsp; It is then in the very nature of
things, of high moment and importance that these Commissioners
should know and understand what large masses of earnest Churchmen
are thinking and feeling, whilst they are finding their way to
their recommendations.&nbsp; It is a duty upon us to let them
know what these feelings are, and what consequences are likely to
result to the Church, when we see their tendency, nay, <i>more
than tendency</i>, to lead an assault upon the Prayer Book.&nbsp;
It is not only not improper, but it is a part of high and holy
duty, which we owe to ourselves, to our Book of Common Prayer, to
our faith, to the Church of England, to Christendom at
large&mdash;nay, to God, our Maker, Redeemer, and Sanctifier, to
say openly and plainly, solemnly and earnestly, &ldquo;We will
have no tampering with our faith; we will have no altering our
Prayer Book; we will have no legislation in this matter of
Ritual;&rdquo; and this all the more; all the more deeply felt,
the more strongly urged, <i>became</i> we see that this is a
wholly one-sided movement.&nbsp; We <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>hear of no restraint or restriction,
no new Canons or new enactments, when men fall short of the
requirements of the Church and the Church&rsquo;s law; when
churches are closed from Sunday to Sunday; when Christ&rsquo;s
people are starved and stinted of their spiritual food and
sustenance by few and far-distant communions; when Services and
Lessons are altered, and Services garbled and curtailed at the
will of this or that priest.&nbsp; Nay, we hear of no
&ldquo;simple and positive enactments,&rdquo; even when men
within the Church&rsquo;s pale deny the inspiration of the Holy
Scriptures; impute absolute ignorance to Christ our Lord, the
ever-blessed Son of God; as, that He did not know as much about
the authorship of the Pentateuch, or the date of certain of the
Psalms, or other facts concerning the Holy Scriptures, as modern
doctors could tell Him; none, when we hear denied the possibility
of miracles; none, when we find explained away and rejected the
duration without end of Hell; none, when it is maintained that we
ought not to pray to the Son of God.&nbsp; I say that upon these
subjects we hear of no Royal commissions, no Bishop&rsquo;s
charges recommending new enactments; no impending legislation to
place such teaching under the disability of
&ldquo;<i>abeyance</i>&rdquo; even &ldquo;until further order be
taken;&rdquo; but here, where the law of the Church as to
ceremonies and vestments (things no doubt important, because no
doubt representing doctrine and connected with it, but certainly
not more important than those other subjects to which I have
alluded), but here, where these ceremonies and vestments, are the
objects of ignorant clamour and brutal violence, the Prayer Book
is to be altered, and new law is to be made, actually to put a
penalty on those who have been guilty only of the crime of
obeying it as it is.</p>
<p>And here I must say a word as to such alteration of the law,
if made, being what one of the resolutions passed at St.
James&rsquo;s Hall termed it, <i>ex post facto</i>
legislation.&nbsp; A good deal has been said upon this topic, and
we are told that if you call such legislation <i>ex post
facto</i>, then all legislation is such, when it forbids for the
future what has been permitted in the past; and we are reminded
that the true sense of <i>ex </i><a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span><i>post facto</i> legislation is when
a penalty is placed, by a new law, upon acts done before the law
was altered.&nbsp; Now first let me remark that, even without
coming exactly up to the definition, you yet draw very near to
the substance of <i>ex post facto</i> legislation if you make a
one-sided change to catch only one side or one party whom you
make offenders under the new law, and when it is a law framed
expressly and on purpose to catch the men on one side and let the
others go free.&nbsp; Whether this be technically <i>ex post
facto</i> or not, it comes exactly to that which, in a passage
already quoted from the Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol&rsquo;s
Charge, is described by him as likely to cause &ldquo;rankling
bitterness, from the thus greatly increased conviction that the
law is really in favour of those to be restrained; and being so,
is overridden by an <i>unjust Act of Parliament</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But, secondly, there is another way in which such an enactment
would come very near indeed to <i>ex post facto</i>
legislation&mdash;I mean where it disturbs a great settlement of
many years&rsquo; standing, which has induced men to enter into
numerous and weighty engagements, from which you cannot free them
if you would, when you change their <i>status</i> in relation to
their obligations.&nbsp; To take an illustration.&nbsp; The
country has entered into such a kind of contract with the
fundholder.&nbsp; Millions are embarked in the Funds upon the
faith of a great settlement the principles of which shall never
be departed from; and to depart from which would be <i>ex post
facto</i> legislation, practically putting a penalty upon those
who had come under voluntary obligations upon the strength of
those principles and that settlement.&nbsp; But it may be said,
nevertheless, the country does sometimes vary the contracts and
alter the rate of interest towards its creditors.&nbsp; Yes! but
what would be thought of the minister who proposed to do this,
without offering, as the alternative, to pay the lender off in
full; to replace him in the position in which he stood
originally?&nbsp; And if, without offering this, he proposed to
alter his <i>status</i>, who would not feel there was an unjust
<i>ex post facto</i> alteration of the law?&nbsp; Now, upon such
a great, just, and deliberate settlement, have men <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>entered into
relations with the established Church of this country.&nbsp; And
here the State <i>cannot</i> set them free, or replace them in
the position in which they stood before they accepted the cure of
souls within her pale.&nbsp; The Legislature <i>cannot</i> give
them the alternative offer: and therefore, again, such a change
as alters the Catholic standing of the Church of England must
come very near indeed to being <i>ex post facto</i>
legislation.&nbsp; But yet further, thirdly, there is another
consideration which brings this case exactly within the strictest
definition of <i>ex post facto</i> legislation.&nbsp; I mean the
affixing a penalty by new enactment upon acts done before the law
was changed.&nbsp; Observe, all penalty is not material; not
restricted to fine or suspension.&nbsp; There is the penalty of
stigma and imputed dishonesty, as real and as hard to bear in
many cases as other punishment.&nbsp; Now, it needs no great
foresight or wisdom to perceive that if the law of Ritual shall
be altered in the sense and mode proposed, this very thing will
be used as a stigma and brand of disloyalty to the Church of
England against those men who have been High Ritualists.&nbsp; It
is true it might be, and in my judgment, ought to be, read the
other way.&nbsp; It ought to be taken as a proof that the
existing law being in their favour, those who could not endure
the law got it altered.&nbsp; But, from the whole tone and temper
of the objectors, it is clear this would not be their line.&nbsp;
They tell us even now, over and over again, with the outstretched
throat of clamour, and with the utmost violence of passion, that
all such are false to the principles of the Reformation; are
dishonest and disloyal to their Church; are not to be endured in
a Protestant Establishment.&nbsp; It is clear, then, that they
would proclaim the new legislation to be merely <i>declaratory
of</i> the existing law; not admit that it <i>changed</i> it; and
so the enactment would be used as a fresh ground of obloquy and
reproach against those whom their opponents could not convict of
any crime, but whom they would thus be allowed, nevertheless to
condemn.&nbsp; Such a stigma, such a penalty placed by
legislation upon acts done before the change of law, and upon the
persons who had done them, <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>would bring such change of law under
the definition, in the strictest sense, of <i>ex post facto</i>
legislation.</p>
<p>But now to return.&nbsp; Let me explain the position which I
am throughout maintaining.&nbsp; I have not been speaking as the
advocate of high Ritual.&nbsp; I do not understand the aim of the
great meeting held last week in St. James&rsquo;s Hall to be this
advocacy; nor do I so understand the Memorial to be laid before
the Commissioners.&nbsp; It is not to defend high Ritual in
itself, however incidentally Ritual may be affected; but it is to
defend the Prayer Book.&nbsp; It is to preserve our present
<i>status</i>.&nbsp; It is to allow no door to be shut upon the
Catholic side, whilst all are left open on the
Latitudinarian.&nbsp; It is to preserve an outwork which defends
doctrine&mdash;dearer than life to many among us.&nbsp; It is to
keep all which God&rsquo;s providence has given us in our
Reformation and subsequent Revisions.&nbsp; It is to preserve our
character and place in the face of Christendom; it is to shew our
loving memory and gratitude for all which our blessed Lord has
done for us, and is still doing at the right hand of God, that we
will not consent to have this our heritage mutilated or taken
from us.&nbsp; And surely in this all Churchmen who believe the
ancient Catholic Faith are interested with us, Ritualist or
non-Ritualist.&nbsp; I am not myself a Ritualist in the sense of
using any of the higher forms of ritual, ceremonial, or
vesture.&nbsp; I believe indeed, and who that believes the
doctrine so represented, but <i>must</i> believe, that England
would be in a higher, holier, and happier state, if, not
neglecting one other point of holiness, humility, repentance, or
faith, yet, I say, if all among us longed for and delighted in
the higher and fuller expression of the faith.&nbsp; But I do not
think this fuller expression is to be forced on those who are
unprepared for it.&nbsp; I believe in many cases this would
hinder rather than help the doctrine.&nbsp; And I have been
accustomed to consider that the <i>abeyance</i> of much of the
usage (I take the term in its true sense of a practical
discontinuance, not of a legal forbidding, which is the repeal or
extinction of a thing), that such abeyance may well justify us in
not harshly shocking prejudices or wounding <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>feelings;
and, therefore, certainly it is not as a mere movement in support
of the higher forms of ritual that I am addressing you:&mdash;but
I ask this;&mdash;What is the object of our opponents?&nbsp;
Assuredly not merely to put down vestments, or put out candles,
or extinguish incense; but to drive out of the Church of England
the whole doctrine which those things represent; to expel every
one, whether Ritualist or not, who holds and teaches it; to run
riot in the destruction of every vestige of faith in the Real
Presence, in the Priesthood, the Altar, and the Sacrifice.&nbsp;
The papers of the Church Association (<i>passim</i>), the
writings of the whole anti-Ritualistic world, who are also the
anti-Sacerdotal party, from the well-known noisy and ignorant
correspondents of the <i>Times</i> to the miserable man who so
lately has shocked every feeling of decency in his, at first,
most impertinent, and, at last, most blasphemous, correspondence
with and concerning the late revered Bishop of Lichfield; all
such proclaim this as their aim and end, with open mouth and
outstretched throat.&nbsp; If you ask for an example, take the
following brief passage brought before the English Church Union
at its anniversary meeting in June last, by Mr. Charles Wood in
his excellent speech on that occasion.&nbsp; He
said&mdash;&ldquo;In an article that appeared in one of the
periodicals, which is most conspicuous in its attacks upon
Ritual&mdash;I mean <i>Frazer&rsquo;s Magazine</i>&mdash;I found,
in one of its last year&rsquo;s numbers, this, &lsquo;There is no
use in taking half-measures.&nbsp; As long as the Ordination
Service remains as it is, Ritualism will always be cropping
up.&nbsp; The real remedy is to alter a single rubric.&nbsp;
Forbid the imposition of hands, and then we shall get rid of
Ritualism once and for all.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a
name="citation41"></a><a href="#footnote41"
class="citation">[41]</a>&nbsp; Surely such language as this, and
it is the very staple of the fierce opponents of Ritual, should
open the eyes of all Churchmen as to what it is, (that it is
really vital doctrine,) for which we have to contend.&nbsp; I
say, then, that the present contest and crisis touches every
Churchman, Ritualist or not, who believes the higher
doctrine.&nbsp; Nay, it touches every one, Ritualist or not, who
does <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>not
desire to see the comprehensive character of the Church of
England narrowed, in a party sense, and for a party
purpose.&nbsp; It touches all who agree with what the Dean of
Norwich lately said at Wolverhampton, that it would be an immense
and incalculable evil if one great school of thought in the
Church of England were to drive the other out of her (though, by
the way, I think he did not note what surely in justice he should
have noted, that it is only on the one side that this desire for
expulsion has been expressed).&nbsp; It touches in short all who
desire to let law and reason have fair play against clamour and
violence; all who will stand <i>by</i> and <i>for</i> the Prayer
Book as it is.&nbsp; Let us all join hand and heart in averting
the present danger, and in defending our heritage.&nbsp; Oh! if I
may say it, believe me, friends, there has been no such crisis as
now is in our Church, in our day at least.</p>
<p>Bear with me a few moments longer whilst I confirm what I have
said by a better warrant than any word of mine.&nbsp; In the year
1865, he whose name is perhaps more revered among us than any
name of at least this century&mdash;he whose memory is &ldquo;as
galbanum, and onyx, and sweet storax, and as the fume of
frankincense in the tabernacle,&rdquo; the &ldquo;sweet
singer&rdquo; of our Israel&mdash;wrote and published some
thoughts upon Ritual, and the doctrine represented by it, and the
growing opposition to it.&nbsp; In almost, as it seems, a spirit
of prophecy, speaking of the very matter now in question&mdash;a
proposal for legislation, touching thereby the integrity of the
Prayer Book&mdash;he said:&mdash;&ldquo;It professes, indeed, to
meddle with one rubric only, but it involves the same prerogative
over all, and that which it specifies is one of the most
important and comprehensive, bearing directly on one vital
doctrine, and through that, as theologians know, upon the whole
Creed of the Church.&nbsp; And what is more, those who promote
the movement openly avow that their object is thus comprehensive
. . .&nbsp; They frankly own their purpose to be, not simple
reformation of that one rubric, but the discomfiture at all
points of a rival section in the Church.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
adds:&mdash;&ldquo;It is well perhaps that they have declared
themselves so openly.&nbsp; It <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>may put many on their guard who might
otherwise have supported them at least passively, as not liking
the special usages complained of, or as fearful of their being
revived where they would cause disturbance.&nbsp; Whoever after
this their plain speaking shall join in their movement must be
aware that he is committing himself to a one-sided policy, which
ultimately displacing those who are called Tractarians or the
like, will quite overthrow the sort of equilibrium which for many
years has providentially subsisted among us.&rdquo; <a
name="citation43a"></a><a href="#footnote43a"
class="citation">[43a]</a></p>
<p>So clearly did John Keble see that the attempt to alter that
one rubric on ornaments was a matter of most vital importance to
Sacramental doctrine.&nbsp; And if he spoke thus when the plan
referred to was but in its infancy, and the danger more remote,
need anyone be told what he would advise now?&nbsp; Truly,
&ldquo;he being dead yet speaketh.&rdquo;&nbsp; Who is there that
will not hear? <a name="citation43b"></a><a href="#footnote43b"
class="citation">[43b]</a></p>
<p>He adds this yet further, well worthy of our most heartfelt
contemplation:&mdash;&ldquo;And if we look beyond our own
country, as surely we are bound to do, certain it is that such a
decree&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i>, an Act of Parliament altering the
rubric), &ldquo;not only submitted to but promoted and solicited
by the Convocation of the Province of Canterbury, would
effectually quench, for the time at least, all the fond hopes of
reunion among Christians which just now appear to be dawning on
us in various quarters.&nbsp; For, undoubtedly of all doctrines,
that of the Eucharistic Sacrifice is the one on which in the eyes
both of East and West our Catholicity would <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>appear most
questionable.&nbsp; A <i>hair&rsquo;s-breadth</i> more of
wavering on that point would seem to them, I fear, an entire
forfeiture of our position.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh, how noble and
catholic an aspiration after a reunion with East and West, and
how just an appreciation of what would vitally affect, adversely,
the hope and prospect of it!&nbsp; How different from the narrow
sectarianism which would boast of our isolation, and, cavilling
at everything, can see only an overture to Rome in an
&ldquo;Eirenicon&rdquo; to Christendom.&nbsp; O that our
Convocations may hear and heed such warning words, and stand
firm, whatever trial comes!&nbsp; Let me hope, let me pray, that
all true Churchmen, Ritualists or not, will here throw themselves
into the gap, and raise a bulwark against tampering with our
Prayer Book.&nbsp; The outwork may be the rubric on ornaments,
but, &ldquo;as theologians know,&rdquo; it is the Creed which is
really at stake, through an altered Book of Common Prayer.&nbsp;
We must defend the outwork to defend the citadel.&nbsp; We must
one and all make our voice heard against change here, either
directly or indirectly, either explicitly or implicitly, either
by Convocation or by Parliament, or by both together.&nbsp;
Better our Convocations were silenced again for a hundred years,
if any minister of the Crown would venture to silence them (which
I shall not believe until I see it), than that they should lend
themselves to alter our Prayer Book and impair its
catholicity.&nbsp; But to strengthen the hands of all who have
power or influence herein, we must be prompt, energetic, valiant,
wise.&nbsp; Believe me it is not a question of shapes or
colours.&nbsp; It is not a question of supporting the Ritualists,
though incidentally their position may be supported.&nbsp; But it
is the question of not losing one jot or tittle of what
God&rsquo;s providence has given us.&nbsp; And to preserve what
we have is essential to our work at home and to our place in
Christendom.&nbsp; We cannot afford to give away our
birthright.&nbsp; We cannot afford to be diverted by any
<i>bye</i> enquiries or cavils.&nbsp; The real question is the
preservation intact in its integrity of our Book of Common
Prayer, and with it of Catholic doctrine and truth among us.</p>
<p>I have used the term&mdash;our place in Christendom.&nbsp; Let
<a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>me add a
word or two more upon this.&nbsp; English Churchmen, I fear, are
too apt to overlook that we are but a small part of the Church
Universal, and that our aspirations should ever be that
&ldquo;the unhappy divisions&rdquo; which now prevail in it may
be healed, and the Church again be <i>one</i> (according to our
Blessed Lord&rsquo;s Prayer), that indeed &ldquo;the world may
believe that God hath sent Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, with this feeling and this hope in our hearts, we must
never allow ourselves to forget that there is such a thing as an
&OElig;cumenical Council of Christendom, and whatever the
difficulties may be in the way of its assembling, I believe to it
all true hearts should turn.&nbsp; Certainly, for myself, I can
say that this, as the great remedy for all our troubles and
distractions, and &ldquo;not for ours only,&rdquo; but for those
of Christendom at large, has been constantly present to my mind
for many years.&nbsp; That God in His mercy, and in His own good
time, would grant us a true General Council to ease and compose
our differences, and to restore the unity of
Christendom,&mdash;and, if it come, grant us all the due mind of
submission to it,&mdash;has been for nearly or quite a quarter of
a century, a portion of my daily prayer; and I think there is no
ground to decry the petition as either fanciful or wrong.&nbsp;
At least we have the warrant of some of great name among us who
have not thought so.&nbsp; &ldquo;That I might live to see the
reunion of Christendom,&rdquo; says Archbishop Bramhall,
&ldquo;is a thing for which I shall always bow the knees of my
heart to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . . .&nbsp;
Howsoever it be,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;I submit myself and my
poor endeavours first to the judgment of the Catholic
&OElig;cumenical essential Church, which, if some of late days
have endeavoured to hiss out of the schools, as a fancy, I cannot
help it.&nbsp; From the beginning it was not so. . . .&nbsp;
Likewise I submit myself to the representative Church&mdash;that
is, a free General Council, or so general as can be procured; and
until then to the Church of England, wherein I was baptized, or
to a National English Synod.&rdquo; <a name="citation45"></a><a
href="#footnote45" class="citation">[45]</a></p>
<p>It may be supposed, indeed, that a general or &OElig;cumenical
<a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>Council is
at present hopeless, and therefore that all mention or thought of
an appeal to it is out of place; but I do not think this, for two
reasons&mdash;first, that there are certain points of doctrine
which have been so definitely ruled by General Councils and
consent of Christendom that we know upon them there could be no
diverse judgment; and, secondly, that I see no cause to despair
of another such Council in God&rsquo;s good time being called
together.&nbsp; Even in the meanwhile the thought of, and
habitual mental reference to, such a Council is neither
impertinent nor unpractical; for the remembrance and sense of its
authority, and the even mental submission of the will to its
rule, has the strongest tendency to keep a man wholly catholic in
heart and act.&nbsp; An English Churchman should <i>live</i> in
the thought and in the hope of the voice of Christendom being
again uttered with no uncertain sound as to matters of perplexity
and doubt.&nbsp; Even &ldquo;though it tarry, he will wait for
it,&rdquo; and in the meanwhile the thought of it will bear its
fruit.&nbsp; Thus, whatever he does, and is obliged to do,
without the actual presence of such a guide, will be done, not on
the mere impulse of his own will, or the bent of his own mind,
but always in relation to what Christendom has definitely ruled,
and in implicit submission to what she will again say when she
may meet once more in a free and General Council.&nbsp; Anyone so
living, trusting, believing, acting, will never be a schismatic,
and cannot be a heretic.&nbsp; But I do believe we shall never,
till we get to look out of ourselves to Christendom at large;
never, till we remember our due place in it; never, till we are
ready to accept its decrees (when God sees Christendom fit to
give them); never till then, shall we be in that right mind and
heart which is waiting duly for the Bridegroom&rsquo;s call.</p>
<p>I am quite prepared to have such remarks called visionary and
unreal, and all dependance upon, nay, all reference to, the
Universal Church, unpractical and absurd.&nbsp; But none of these
things move me, and I am (though, I trust, no fanatic) yet
hopeful of the help of God for those who will try to help
themselves.&nbsp; As I have said, I cannot think the expectation
of a General Council is chimerical.&nbsp; I cannot <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>believe, if
it come, it will be useless.&nbsp; We have no right, of course,
to expect any supernatural interposition or handwriting visibly
on the wall to direct us in our difficulties.&nbsp; But I have
faith enough in miracles, if that be one, to believe that God may
grant us the miracle of Christendom again in Council, and make it
the means to heal all our distempers and bind up all our
wounds.&nbsp; Of this faith and this hope no man shall deprive me
by the mere calculations of human policy, or by the perverse
promptings of an uncatholic despair.&nbsp; But let us all watch
and pray, and work with the help of God, to preserve our true
catholic heritage and place, lest, when it meet, it should meet
to condemn us.&nbsp; But this we will never believe can come upon
us until we see, which God forbid, our Church faithless to God
and to herself in the face of Christendom.</p>
<p>Our immediate work, our present duty, is indeed on a narrower
scale and in a smaller sphere, yet not without an eye to these
further consequences.&nbsp; It is to maintain our catholic
<i>status</i>; and in order to this, to make it plain to all,
friends and foes alike, that we will stand by our Prayer Book,
and never consent to alter in an uncatholic direction one jot or
tittle of that which it contains.</p>

class="footnote">[16]</a>&nbsp; If the Commissioners should
justify their thus reporting on things not essential, in the face
of the very letter of their instructions, by saying that they
understand the term essential to be <i>relative</i>; essential,
not necessarily to the <i>Being</i>, but to the <i>well-being</i>
of the Church, and that the repression of the vestments is, in
their mind, thus relatively essential; it occurs immediately to
ask, why, if they were thus so quickwitted to perceive this sense
of relative essentiality on their own side, were they so obtuse
in seeing that the same construction should equally be allowed to
the witnesses examined, in their use of the word essential on the
other side?</p>
<p>Or, further, if they should plead that although the things
themselves were <i>unessential</i>, yet the <i>liberty</i> to
deal with them was <i>essential</i>, (and in their mind essential
on the side of repression,) and that thus their recommendation to
restrain ceremonial is brought within the terms of their
Commission; it must again be asked, why did they not award the
same latitude of construction to the witnesses upon whose
evidence they ground their sole recommendation; when it would be
seen immediately that their inference and conclusion are wholly
illogical and absurd.&nbsp; For their reasoning fully stated
would then run thus:&mdash;&ldquo;We find the vestments are by
none regarded as essential to the <i>Being</i>, though we are
aware that by many they are considered essential to the
<i>well-being</i> of the Church; and <i>therefore</i> we come to
the opinion that all variations in respect of vesture be
restrained and abolished.&rdquo;&nbsp; Or, (on the other view,)
&ldquo;We find the vestments are by none regarded as in
themselves essential, though by many the liberty to use them is
regarded as essential, and <i>therefore</i> we recommend that
they be repressed and disallowed.&rdquo;&nbsp; What must be said
of a Report the compilers of which can only present even the
semblance of avoiding direct collision with the terms of their
appointment by such treatment of the word <i>essential</i>; who
claim this latitude of interpretation on their own side, whilst
they wholly overlook or deny the same to the witnesses whose
evidence they desire to make responsible for their illogical
conclusion?&nbsp; Truly if the Commissioners have taken such
interpretations for themselves, and in the same breath deny them
to the witnesses whom they quote, what words can be too strong to
describe their blindness if they did not see this incongruity, or
their unfairness if they did; whilst, if to escape such a
dilemma, they repudiate both the above pleas, what defence can
they make against the just rebuke of the trenchant Archdeacon of
Taunton, when he said at Wolverhampton that &ldquo;they had been
appointed to report only upon things <i>essential</i>, and had
reported only upon things <i>non-essential</i>&rdquo;?</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
